---------------------------------project create process ---------------------------------

python -m venv VENV                                             (creates venv in curr folder)   

cd VENV\Scripts                                                 (to change to venv Directory when in project folder)

.\activate                                                      (activates venv)   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Unrestricted (incase vs code throws task errors on activate)

pip install django                                              (installs django deps)

cd projectFolder                                               (go back to outside folder so we can create django boilerplate)    

django-admin startproject playground_site                       (creates and installs empty django project in that folder)

cd playground_site                                              (now go to project)

python manage.py migrate                                        (creates sqllite project)


python manage.py runserver                                      (runs dev server in browser)

----------------------------some more managment stuff---------------------------------
python manage.py startapp pages                                 (doing this in root folder will create a django app template)
(this has to be added to site settings.py to be recognized)



ython manage.py makemigrations pages                            (migrates the model to the database)             
python manage.py migrate                

python manage.py createsuperuser                                (creates admin for /admin view)


-----------------------------------some notes-----------------------------------
MTV process
MODEL retrieves data from VIEW which applies business logic and formats that data, then sends it to TEMPLATE which renders that data
this can be done in any order depending on project

apps should be seperate in django, and do one thing each, the whole project should have many apps
it is good practice to rename the outer folder after creation, so it doesn't have the same name as inner folder (add _root or something)
